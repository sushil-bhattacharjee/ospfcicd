Requirements
------------

You need Python 3.6+

pylibssh requires libssh to be installed in particular:

- libssh version 0.9.0 and later.

  To install libssh refer to its `Downloads page
  <https://www.libssh.org/get-it/>`__.


Building the module
-------------------

In the local env, assumes there's a libssh shared library
on the system, build toolchain is present and env vars
are set properly:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh.git
    $ cd pylibssh
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox -e build-dists

``manylinux``-compatible wheels:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh.git
    $ cd pylibssh
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox -e build-dists-manylinux1-x86_64  # with Docker

    # or with Podman
    $ DOCKER_EXECUTABLE=podman tox -e build-dists-manylinux1-x86_64

    # to enable shell script debug mode use
    $ tox -e build-dists-manylinux1-x86_64 -- -e DEBUG=1

v1.2.0
======

*(2024-06-07)*


Bug fixes
---------

- ansible-pylibssh no longer crashes when received EOF or when channel is not explicitly
  closed -- by `@pbrezina <https://github.com/sponsors/pbrezina>`__.

  Previously, ansible-pylibssh crashed if ``channel.recv`` was called and ``libssh``
  returned ``SSH_EOF`` error. It also crashed on some special occasions where
  channel was not explicitly closed and the session object was garbage-collected
  first.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#576 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/576>`__.


Features
--------

- Started exposing the ``SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES``
  and ``SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`` options publicly
  -- by `@Qalthos <https://github.com/sponsors/Qalthos>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#527 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/527>`__.

- The ``request_exec()`` method was added to the ``Channel`` class. It exposes an
  interface for calling the respective low-level C-API of the underlying
  ``libssh`` library -- by `@pbrezina <https://github.com/sponsors/pbrezina>`__.

  Additionally, the following calls to ``libssh`` are now available in the same
  class: ``request_exec()``, ``send_eof()``, ``request_send_signal()`` and
  ``is_eof`` which is exposed as a ``property``.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#576 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/576>`__.


Improved documentation
----------------------

- Fixed spelling of "Connect" in the ``Session.connect()``
  docstring -- by `@donnerhacke <https://github.com/sponsors/donnerhacke>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#474 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/474>`__.

- Added a tip to the ``installation guide``
  on how to set compiler flags when installing from source
  -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#499 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/499>`__.

- Fixed the example of invoking remote commands by using
  ``Channel.exec_command()`` in snippets -- by `@pbrezina <https://github.com/sponsors/pbrezina>`__.

  Its previously showcased version wasn't functional.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#576 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/576>`__.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- A flaw in the logic for copying the project directory into a
  temporary folder that led to infinite recursion when ``TMPDIR``
  was set to a project subdirectory path. This was happening in Fedora
  and its downstream due to the use of `pyproject-rpm-macros
  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros>`__. It was
  only reproducible with ``pip wheel`` and was not affecting the
  ``pyproject-build`` users.

  -- by `@hroncok <https://github.com/sponsors/hroncok>`__ and `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  `89c9b3a <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/commit/89c9b3a>`__.

- From now on, the published distribution package artifacts
  for the new releases are signed via `Sigstore
  <https://sigstore.dev>`__ -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  This is happening as a part of the GitHub Actions CI/CD
  workflow automation and the signatures are uploaded to
  the corresponding GitHub Release pages.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  `986988a <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/commit/986988a>`__.

- The platform-specific macOS wheels are now built using the
  Python interpreter from https://python.org. They are tagged
  with ``macosx_10_9`` -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#333 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/333>`__.

- The ``toml`` build time dependency has been replaced with
  ``tomli`` -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  The ``tomli`` distribution is only pulled in under Python
  versions below 3.11. On 3.11 and higher, the standard
  library module ``tomllib`` is now used instead.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#501 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/501>`__.

- Started using the built-in ``setuptools-scm`` Git archive
  support under Python 3.7 and higher -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#502 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/502>`__.

- Added support for Python 3.12 -- by `@Qalthos <https://github.com/sponsors/Qalthos>`__.

  It is now both tested in the CI and is advertised through
  the Trove classifiers.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#532 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/532>`__.

- The ``Cython`` build time dependency now has the minimum
  version of 3.0 under Python 3.12 and higher
  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  The previous versions of ``Cython`` are still able to build
  the project under older Python versions.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#540 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/540>`__.

- `PEP 660 <https://peps.python.org/pep-660>`__ is now enabled -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  Previously, due to restrictive `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ hook reimports,
  our in-tree build backend was losing ``non-PEP 517``
  hooks implemented in newer versions of ``setuptools`` but not
  the earlier ones. This is now addressed by reexporting
  everything that ``setuptools`` exposes with a wildcard.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#541 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/541>`__.

- The ``setuptools-scm`` build dependency CI pin was updated to 8.1.0 â€”
  this version fixes a date parsing incompatibility introduced by Git 2.45.0
  (GitHub: ``pypa/setuptools_scm#1038``,
  GitHub: ``pypa/setuptools_scm#1039``)
  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#601 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/601>`__.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- The ``changelog`` page for the tagged release builds on
  Read The Docs does not attempt showing the draft section
  anymore -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  `852d259 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/commit/852d259>`__.

- Adjusted the publishing workflow automation to pre-configure
  Git before attempting to create a tag when building a
  source distribution -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related commits on GitHub:*
  `f07296f <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/commit/f07296f>`__.

- The CI configuration for building the macOS platform-specific
  wheels switched to using ``cibuildwheel`` -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#333 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/333>`__.

- The OS-level tox package was upgraded to v3.28.0 in the UBI9
  CI runtime -- by `@Qalthos <https://github.com/sponsors/Qalthos>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#461 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/461>`__, `#473 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/473>`__.

  packaging in the CI/CD infrastructure -- by `@Qalthos <https://github.com/sponsors/Qalthos>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#533 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/533>`__.

- Switched back to using Cython's native plugin for measuring
  code coverage -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#538 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/538>`__.

- Added separate changelog fragment types for contributor-
  and downstream-facing patches -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  Their corresponding identifiers are ``contrib`` and ``packaging``
  respectively. They are meant to be used for more accurate
  classification, where one would resort to using ``misc`` otherwise.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#539 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/539>`__.

- `PEP 660 <https://peps.python.org/pep-660>`__ is now enabled -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  This effectively means that the ecosystem-native editable
  install mode started working properly.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#541 <https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh/issues/541>`__.

- The duplicated jobs matrices for building manylinux wheels
